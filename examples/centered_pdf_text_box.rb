# Controllers can be though of as control classes or interface builders.
# Essentially, they define the options that formatters should implement
# and the stages of rendering they should handle.  Ruport's formatting
# system is very forgiving, and the controllers do not force their
# specs onto formatters that are attached to them.
#
class Document < Ruport::Controller

  # Will throw an error if these options are not set at rendering time
  required_option :text, :author

  # The controller will look for a build_document_body() method on the formatter,
  # but silently skip this stage if it is missing
  stage :document_body

  # The controller will look for a finalize_document() method on the formatter,
  # but silently skip this stage if it is missing
  finalize :document

# Ruport's PDF Formatter has a large number of helpers that simplify some
# basic PDF operations.  For the things it misses, it also provides a
# pdf_writer method that gives you direct access to the underlying PDF::Writer
# library.  If you frequently find yourself using that feature, you might
# consider taking a look at the pdf_writer_proxy plugin for Ruport.
#
# The helpers demonstrated here are add_text, center_image_in_box,
# and render_text_box

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little
statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply
nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak
what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in
hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.--"Ah, so you
shall be sure to be misunderstood."--Is it so bad then to be misunderstood?
Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and
Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever
took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. . . .
