# This example is a simplified version of a tool actually used at BTree.
# It does a very basic task:
#
# Given a master CSV file and a key column, it will compare the file
# to another CSV, and report back what is missing in the second CSV
# that was in the first, as well as what is changed in the second CSV
# based on the first.
#
# It is not bidirectional, and is mostly meant to compare snapshots
# of CSV dumps to see what has been removed or altered (we don't care
# about new records )
#
# It's a camping app, but the core of it is a controller/formatter combo.
# (Marked by %%%%%%%%%%% below)
#
# You'll need the camping omnibus and the F() ruport plugin to run this app.
#
#   gem install camping-omnibus --source http://code.whytheluckystiff.net -y
#   gem install f --source http://gems.rubyreports.org
#
# Once you have them, just run camping commaleon.rb and browse to
# http://localhost:3301
#
# Use ticket_count.csv as your master file and ticket_count2.csv as your
# comparison file.  Use title as your key.
#
# Try out the different outputs, and tweak the app if you'd like to play
# with it.
#
# If your company has a need for tiny hackish camping/ruport amalgams,
# you can always ask Gregory if he's looking for work:
