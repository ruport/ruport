# = What Ruport Is
#
# Ruby Reports (Ruport) is an extensible reporting system.
# 
# It aims to be as lightweight as possible while still providing core support
# for data aggregation and manipulation as well as multi-format rendering 
# of reports.
#
# Ruport provides tools for using a number of data sources, including CSV files,
# ActiveRecord models, and raw SQL connections via RubyDBI (through ruport-util).
#
# Data manipulation is easy as there are standard structures that support
# record, table, and grouping operations.  These all can be extended to
# implement custom behavior as needed.
#
# For common tasks, Ruport provides formatters for CSV, HTML, PDF, and text-
# based reports.  However, the real power lies in building custom report
# controllers and formatters.  The base formatting libraries provide a number 
# of helper functions that will let you build complex reports while maintaining 
# a DRY and consistent interface.
#
# To get a quick feel for what you can accomplish with Ruport, take a look at
# a few simple examples provided on our web site.
#
# http://rubyreports.org/examples.html
#
# Since Ruport's core support is intentionally minimalistic, you may be looking
# for some higher level support for specific needs such as graphing, invoices,
# report mailing support, etc.  For this, you may wish to take a look at the
# ruport-util package, which contains some generally useful tools and libraries
# to extend Ruport's capabilities.
#
# = Installation 
#
# To install ruport via rubygems:
#   
#   sudo gem install ruport 
#
# Check to see if it installed properly:
#
#   ruby -rubygems -e "require 'ruport'; puts Ruport::VERSION"
#
# If you get an error, please let us know on our mailing list. 
#
# Dependencies Details:
#   
#  -- formatting
#
# Ruport relies on PDF::Writer and FasterCSV for its formatting support.
# If you want to make use of textile helpers, you'll also need RedCloth.
#
#  -- database interaction
#
# If you wish to use Ruport to report against a rails project, 
# a camping project, or do standalone acts_as_reportable reports, you'll need
# ActiveRecord and the acts_as_reportable gem.
#
# If you want to use Ruport::Query for raw SQL support, you'll need to 
# install ruport-util, RubyDBI and whatever database drivers you might need.
#
# = Resources              
#
# Our developers have published a free-content book about all things
# Ruport, including complete coverage of acts_as_reportable and some of 
# ruport-util's features.  This book serves as the definitive guide to 
# Ruport, so all users should become acquainted with it:
